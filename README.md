# Tic-Tac-Toe
client-server based c game

This game is ran by running this file as the server in a terminal window, then running nc client in another terminal window.
Multiple clients can be connected at once, however only the first 2 get to play the game. Any subsequent clients can only
send messages to each other. Players can also send messages, but to play a number ranging from 1-9 must be inputted
and only that number, otherwise a message will be displayed. Upon winning, the board is cleared.
